# Cimleh

This is the source code of the game I made for my highschool graduation project (2019).
Overall I worked on this game for about 3 to 4 month in early 2019.

## What's Cimleh ?

Cimleh is a voxel-world fps sandbox (nerdy term for minecraft-clone). The intention was to implement energy gestion throughout different machines inputs and outputs in order to upgrade your technology. Implementing the procedural generation and the save-system as well as getting proper aesthetics took so much time that I barely got to work on the enery gestion part.

The world generation is based on Perlin Noise.
